# Tunr 1.0!

We're going to be building Tunr, the worlds #1 music catalog / player (those
Spotify haters can't keep up with us).

## Part 1 - Database / Schema

In this exercise, your goal is to build out the schema for tunr, load it with
seed data, and run some sample queries to explore the data.

### Create the database

Create a postgres database called `tunr_db`. Make sure to use that **exact**
name, or you'll have trouble later on!

### Create a schema

Inside the db folder, create a `schema.sql` file, and then load it into your
`tunr_db` database.

Here's what our data model looks like:

*Artists*

| column name  | type |
|--------------|------|
| id   | primary key (int) |
| name | text |
| photo_url | text |
| nationality | text |

*Songs*

| column name  | type |
|--------------|------|
|id | primary key (int) |
|title | text |
|album | text |
|preview_url | text |
|artist_id | foreign key (int) |

### Load the Seed Data

Use psql to load the seed data located in `db/seed.sql`

### Play with the data

Using `psql`, play with the database, come up with some interesting sample
queries, and save them in a file in the db folder called `sample_queries.sql`

## Part 2.1 - Create the Artist Model using Active Record

1. Create an app.rb file for this application
2. Create a Gemfile using `bundle init`
3. Create a folder for your models (it should be called `models`)
4. Create a file that will contain your AR class definition for 'artists'
5. Add your dependencies into the Gemfile and then run `bundle install`


## Part 2.2 - Define artists & setup your app.rb to connect to the database

1. Define your artist model in `models/artist.rb`
2. Require your dependencies in `app.rb`
3. Establish connection to database using AR
4. Load pry at the end of `app.rb`

## Part 2.3 - Use your Artist Model

In the console:

1. Find all artists
2. Find just one artist by id
3. Find Taylor Swift (or your other fav artist) by **name**.
4. Find all artists from the USA
5. Find all artists NOT from the USA
6. Create a new artist for your favorite artist
7. Change at least 2 of their attributes
8. Destroy the artist you just created
  - (NOTE: If you destroy other artists at this point, you'll need to reseed your data for consistency.)

## Part 2.4 - Create your Song Model / Setup Associations

1. Create a file that will contain your AR class definition for Songs
2. Make sure to link that file in your main application file
3. Add corresponding associations to your models

## Part 2.5 - Use your Model Associations

1. Find the artist with the name Enya
2. Use AR methods to find all of Enya's songs, store them in a variable
3. Get the first song out of those results and get that song's title
4. Find the song with the title 'Unstoppable' and store in a variable
5. Get that song's artist, store that in a variable
6. Reassign the song's artist to be a different one (your choice)
7. Save that song
8. Create a new song, and associate it with a different artist of your choice
9. Delete that song
10. Find all of Enya's songs again, store in a variable
  - Using `each`, iterate over those songs and for each song, print "I like" + the song name

## Part 3 - Build a RESTful Interface using Sinatra
